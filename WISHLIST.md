#### 1: I would have styled it better with diferent even odd rows styles.
#### 2: I would've used uniform data store across both pages. I didn't because I wanted to demonstrate use of memoization in Sum page.
#### 3: I would've used one single table across both pages. due to shortage of time I couldn't make it resuable across pages.
#### 4: I would've wrote more tests.
#### 5: I would've implemmented a more stricter linting configuration.
#### 6: would've used proper types instead of `any` at some places.
