## Due to Lack of Time I couldn't do some stuff which I've mentioned below.

#### 1: I would have styled it better with responsive design and diferent even odd rows styles.

#### 2: I would've used uniform data store across both pages. I didn't because I wanted to demonstrate use of memoization in Sum page.

#### 3: I would've used one single table across both pages. due to shortage of time I couldn't make it resuable across pages.

#### 4: I would've wrote more tests.

#### 5: I would've implemmented a more stricter linting configuration.

#### 6: would've used proper types instead of `any` at some places.

#### 7: I would've used react-virtualized table to make it more performant.
